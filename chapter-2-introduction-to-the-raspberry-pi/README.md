# Introduction to the Raspberry Pi

The chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of the Raspberry Pi, including its history, specifications, and applications. Readers will learn about the various models of Raspberry Pi and their differences in terms of hardware and capabilities.

## 1. Setting up the Raspberry Pi
The chapter will provide step-by-step instructions on how to set up the Raspberry Pi, from unboxing to booting up. This will include selecting and downloading the appropriate operating system, writing the image to an SD card, and configuring the Raspberry Pi for the first time. The chapter will also cover how to connect peripherals such as a keyboard, mouse, and monitor.

## 2. Connecting remotely to the Raspberry Pi
Readers will learn how to connect to the Raspberry Pi remotely using SSH (Secure Shell) or through Visual Studio Code. This will allow them to control the Raspberry Pi from their computer, which can be more convenient than using a keyboard and monitor directly connected to the Raspberry Pi.

## 3. Testing the cameras
Readers will learn how to connect and test the cameras on the Raspberry Pi. This will include taking pictures and videos using the Raspberry Pi Camera Module, and viewing them in the remote Visual Studio Code. Readers will also learn how to troubleshoot common camera issues.

## 4. Alternative boards
The chapter will provide an overview of alternative boards to the Raspberry Pi, such as the BeagleBone Black, NVIDIA Jetson Nano, and Arduino. Readers will learn about the similarities and differences between these boards and the Raspberry Pi, and how to choose the right board for their project. The chapter will also cover how to set up and configure these alternative boards for 3D vision.
